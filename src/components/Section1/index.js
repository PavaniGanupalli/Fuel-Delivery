        Fuel delivery is the process of transporting fuel, such as gasoline,
        diesel, propane, or biofuels, from a supplier to a customer's location.
        Fuel delivery services are typically used by businesses and individuals
        who require fuel to power their operations, vehicles, or equipment but
        do not have the means to transport fuel themselves.
